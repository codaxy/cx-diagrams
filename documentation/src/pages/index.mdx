    # About CxJS Diagrams

    This library allows you to create interactive diagrams in [CxJS](https://cxjs.io) applications.
    The [Shape](/components/shape) component is used to represent visual elements such as circles and rectangles and allows
    rich styling, click handlers, tooltips and context menus. Elements are easily connected with [Lines](/lines/straight-line) by simply specifying
    identifiers of the beginning and the end shape.
    Layout components, such as [Flow](/components/flow), make it easy to position elements on the diagram automatically, such as in the example below
    which represents the tech stack of this documentation project.
